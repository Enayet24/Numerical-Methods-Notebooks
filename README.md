# ðŸ“Š Numerical Methods in Python
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks from my CSE330: Numerical Methods course. Each notebook implements a fundamental numerical method from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal of this collection is to demonstrate a practical understanding of core concepts in numerical analysis.

## ðŸ“’ Notebooks Overview

### 01_Polynomial_Interpolation.ipynb
- Introduces the concept of polynomial interpolation. Demonstrates how to construct polynomials that pass through a given set of data points using basic interpolation methods.
- Finds the coefficients of an interpolating polynomial by solving a system of linear equations using a Vandermonde matrix.

### 02_Lagrange_Interpolation.ipynb
- Focuses on Lagrange interpolation.
- Constructs a polynomial that passes through a given set of points using the Lagrange polynomial basis.

### 03_Hermite_and_Newtons_Divided_Difference.ipynb
Explores Hermite interpolation and Newton's Divided Difference method:
- Implements Hermite interpolation for cases where derivative values are known.
- Uses Newton's divided-difference method to efficiently find the interpolating polynomial.

### 04_Differentiation_and_Richardson_Extrapolation.ipynb
Covers numerical differentiation:
- Forward, backward, and central differences
- Richardson extrapolation for increasing the accuracy of derivative estimates

### 05_Nonlinear_Equations.ipynb
Solves nonlinear equations using iterative numerical techniques:
- Bisection method
